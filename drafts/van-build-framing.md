I went into this project with minimal wood working or DIY experience. Building the floor, walls, and ceiling proved to be a more difficult and involving task then it first appeared. We completed the following by working MANY hours over the course of a month and half. And by the end of it, I had made enough mistakes that I believe I could complete the same task now in half the time.

## Flooring

We decided early on that we would add insulation, if only because it would be a giant hassle to install later if we wanted it. For the floor we used a mix of 1/4" Polystyrene and 1/2" XPS foam board and for the walls and ceiling we used 1" Polyiso foam board. We chose this insulation for the best blend of R-value (this is a measurement of how well a material insulates) and price. In total we paid around $150-$200 for insulation. In retrospect, using sheeps wool as insulation would have been less toxic, easier to apply, and not terribly more expensive...but we didn't have the patience to wait for a long delivery time.

We put down the 1/4" Polystyene boards first. 1/4" is about the same height as the grooves in the floor of the Promaster, so this acted as a 'leveling' layer.

Next, we installed 1/2" XPS boards. It was VERY tricky to cut these to fit the many curves, nooks, and crannies of the Promaster floorbed. We used cardboard templates first and cut with scissors to get as close as we could. We then used the templates to trace out the cuts on the foam board (a jigsaw is essential). Additional cuts were eyeballed. We discovered later that thick craft paper is sold in giant rolls at Home Depot and Lowes, this would have been much easier to cut for templating purposes. The majority of the time spent here was creating the templates - it takes FAR longer than you'd expect. The XPS was later attached to the van floor using silicone.

The last layer is 1/4" plywood. I chose this thickness to try and keep as much ceiling height as possible - every 1/4" of head height counts, especially for our 6' friends. I think I should have chosen 1/2" for better stability. It is fine to walk on, but it would have been nice to have something thicker to attach the later structures (table, benches, cabinets).

Originally I picked up some particle board thinking it would be good enough. The surface of particle board is rough and would be difficult to install sheet vinyl on. So I returned it and used cheap birch plywood instead. We chose sheet vinyl based on several reports from other van converions that vinyl tiles would flex with the car as we drove and could leak to the subfloor if spilled on. Sheet vinyl is one continuous 'sheet' and is leakproof if not ripped.

The plywood was cut using the XPS as templates and then siliconed to the XPS. Unfortunately some of the wood warped in the heat and created small gaps between the plywood pieces. I attempted to fix this with wood glue...but only created a gritty raised mound between the pieces that we later had to sand down. When we put the sheet vinyl on, the gap between the wood pieces showed through. Not a problem, but a blemish that could likely have been avoided with a thicker wood floor.
