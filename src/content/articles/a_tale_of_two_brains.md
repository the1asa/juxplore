"Computer programming? Really?" My family and friends were nearly as surprised as I was.
I began college undecided with an interest in psychology...and graduated a short six years later with a computer science degree and at least 30 accidental credits.

Growing up I was told I was a certain type, a ‘right-brain’ type for whom reading and writing came naturally, while mathematics and science came only with a struggle. And it was easy for me to believe – after all, who would really want to trade a novel for a calculus textbook? But, as time went on the lines dividing my hemispheres and interests grew fuzzier. 

There were nights my dad would browse through our encyclopedias in the living room and read out entries at random. The information in encyclopedias is biased only by alphabetical ordering - in our set every letter received its own volume (Z was a relatively quick read). A prefix like ‘neut’ might result in back-to-back articles from the fields of physics (neutron), biology (neutrality theory), history (neutrality act), and astronomy (neutron star).
